We own an [Allied Tech Multiprep system - 8"]( https://www.alliedhightech.com/Equipment/multiprep-polishing-system-8) with the [AD-5™ Automatic Fluid Dispenser](https://www.alliedhightech.com/Equipment/ad-5-fluid-dispenser).

# Standard polish

1. Place the regular precision patten on the drive hub gently taking care to align the two "A" symbols.

2. Grit papers are mounted onto the platten with water and the squeege. Water can be dispensed from the tap.

3. Set the fluid dispenser to Menu 2 to dispense green lube (hexalene glycol). Lower the sample towards the stationary plattern using the cam. Drop the sample using the wheel until it touches the surface as registered on the micrometer. Zero the micrometer. Continue down until the micrometer reads the thickness that you would like to remove. Lift the sample on the cam. Choose a rotation speed of, say, 30 RPM, switch on oscillation, and set the spring to, for example, 1 to polish gently. Press the green start button and promptly drop the sample on the cam to start polishing.

4. Proceed with a series of polishing steps following the rule of 3. Each subsequent step in polishing needs to remove three times the prior grit size. A suitable sequence is:
    - 30 um green paper until flat.
    - 9 um blue paper removing at least 90 um.
    - 6 um dark pink paper rememoving at least 30 um
    - 3 um pink paper removing at least 20 um
    - 1 um light purple paper removing at least 10 um

    If material is not being removed, you may need to adjust the spring and/or add the brass weights to apply more force.

    To finish, lift the sample on the cam and then press the red button to stop the platten.

5. For the final step of the polish, remove the precision platten. Place the magnetic platten on the drive hub and mount the red final C felt. Wet the felt with water. Switch to Menu 1 on the fluid dispenser to dispense colloidal silica.

   Polish in this mode for at least 30 mins.

6. Remove the platten and wipe and dry the drive hub. Press 4 on the fluid dispenser to flush the line. Close the tap to the right of the fume hood.

# Maintainence
Corrosion of the platten and clogging of silica inside the fluid delivery system are the main issues to be concenred with.

1. After polishing is completed take the platten off the drive hub and wipe the drive hub clean.

2. Flush the fluid delivery tubes regularly. 

# Alignment
The system should not require frequent alignment, but instructions are provided here:
