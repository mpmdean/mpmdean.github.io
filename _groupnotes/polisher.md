We own an [Allied Tech Multiprep system - 8"]( https://www.alliedhightech.com/Equipment/multiprep-polishing-system-8) with the [AD-5™ Automatic Fluid Dispenser](https://www.alliedhightech.com/Equipment/ad-5-fluid-dispenser).

# Standard polish

1. Place the regular precision patten on the drive hub gently taking care to align the two "A" symbols.

3. Proceed with a series of polishing steps following the rule of 3. Each subsequent step in polishing needs to remove three times the prior grit size. A suitable sequence is:
    - 30 um blue paper until flat.
    - 6 um XXX paper removing at least 90 um.

4. Set the fluid dispenser to Menu 2 to dispense YYY. Lower the sample on the cam. Drop the sample using the wheel until in touches the surfaces as registered on the micrometer. Continue down until the micrometer reads the thickness that you would like to remove. Lift the sample on the cam. Choose a rotation speed of, say, 30 RPM, switch on CCCC, and set the spring to, for example, 1 to polish gently. Press the green start button, drop the sample on the cam. 

    If material is not being removed, you may need to adjust the spring and/or add the brass weights.

    To finish, lift the sample on the cam and then press the red button to stop the platten.

5. Remove the precision platten. Place the magnetic platten on the drive hub and mount the red final C felt. Wet the felt with water. Switch to Menu 1 to dispense colloidal silica

6. Remove the platten and wipe and dry the drive hub. Press 4 on the fluid dispenser to flush the line. Close the tap to the right of the fume hood.

# Maintainence
Corrosion of the platten and clogging of silica inside the fluid delivery system are the main issues to be concenred with.

1. After polishing is completed take the platten off the drive hub and wipe the drive hub clean.

2. Flush the fluid delivery tubes regularly. 

# Alignment
The system should not require frequent alignment, but instructions are provided here:
